# Optimizing Customer Retention and ROI through Predictive CLV Modeling 

# Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Prediction

## Project Overview

This project focuses on predicting Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) using transactional data from an online retail store. The goal is to develop a robust model that can accurately estimate the future value of customers based on their purchasing behavior. The predicted CLV is then used to inform business strategies such as customer segmentation, targeted marketing, and budget optimization, ultimately driving increased return on investment (ROI).

## Technical Aspects

### Data Preprocessing
- **Missing Values**: Handled missing values in the `CustomerID` and `Description` columns by removing rows with missing `CustomerID`, which is critical for customer-level analysis, and rows with missing `Description` when necessary.
- **Duplicates**: Identified and removed 5,268 duplicate records to ensure data quality and avoid biased analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: Created key features such as Recency, Frequency, and Monetary (RFM) values, along with additional features like Average Order Value and Profit Margin, which are crucial for predicting CLV.

### Model Development
- **Models Evaluated**: Implemented various regression models, including Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, Lasso Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Support Vector Regression.
- **Model Selection**: Linear Regression emerged as the best-performing model based on metrics such as RMSE, MSE, MAE, and R².

### Evaluation Metrics
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**
- **R² Score**

### Model Interpretation and Validation
- **Feature Importance**: Analyzed the coefficients of the Linear Regression model to understand the impact of each feature on CLV.
- **Residual Analysis**: Conducted residual analysis to ensure model assumptions were met and to validate the consistency of the predictions.
- **Cross-Validation**: Performed cross-validation to confirm the model's robustness and generalizability across different data subsets.

## Business Use Case

### Objective
The primary business use case for this project is to leverage the predicted CLV to enhance decision-making in marketing and customer relationship management. By identifying high-value customers and understanding the factors that drive CLV, the business can:

- **Optimize Marketing Spend**: Allocate marketing resources more effectively by focusing on customers with the highest predicted lifetime value.
- **Targeted Marketing**: Design personalized marketing campaigns for different customer segments based on their CLV, improving customer retention and increasing sales.
- **Customer Segmentation**: Segment customers into high, medium, and low-value categories to tailor engagement strategies and maximize lifetime revenue.

### Key Learnings
- **Data Preprocessing**: The importance of thorough data cleaning and preprocessing, including handling missing values and duplicates, to ensure the quality and accuracy of the analysis.
- **Modeling Techniques**: Gained hands-on experience with various regression models and learned how to apply regularization techniques to prevent overfitting in Linear Regression models.
- **Model Interpretation**: Enhanced understanding of model interpretation, particularly in linear models, where feature coefficients provide valuable insights into customer behavior.
- **Business Insights**: Learned how to translate technical model outputs into actionable business insights that can drive significant improvements in marketing strategy and customer management.

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of predictive modeling to solve a critical business problem—estimating Customer Lifetime Value. By combining technical rigor with strategic business insights, the model developed in this project offers a valuable tool for optimizing customer relationships and driving long-term business growth.
